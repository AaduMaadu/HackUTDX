The way it works:
- Python script reads only fugitive cases (other cases where there is either no leak or insufficient data)
- Calculate magnitude of leakage by processing leakrate and time duration and display a chart to easily locate anomalies.
- The longitide and latitude of the leak points are neatly displayed in a website
- Website to quickly check at a glance' notice about the status of the pipeline
